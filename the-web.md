# How does the Internet Work?

> When it comes to the World Wide Web, most pages are written using the same language, HTML, which is passed around using a common protocol — HTTP. HTTP is the common internet language (dialect, or specification), allowing a Windows machine, for example, to sing in harmony with a machine running the latest and greatest version of Linux (Do Re Mi!). Through the use of a web browser, a special piece of software that interprets HTTP and renders HTML into a human-readable form, web pages authored in HTML on any type of computer can be read anywhere, including telephones, PDAs and even popular games consoles. 

>Even though they’re speaking the same language, the various devices accessing the web need to have some rules in place to be able to talk to one another — it’s like learning to raise your hand to ask a question in class. HTTP lays out these ground rules for the Internet. Because of HTTP, a client machine (like your computer) knows that it has to be the one to initiate a request for a web page; it sends this request to a server. A server is a computer where web sites reside — when you type a web address into your browser, a server receives your request, finds the web page you want, and sends it back to your computer to be displayed in your web browser. - Wikipedia
