# Learning Web Development

## What This Book Is for
This gitbook is a review of all I've learned and will learn about modern web development. It will start with fundamentals and continue to more advance abstractions. This will be a living document that I will come back to remind myself of how much I have taken in and how much more I do not know. 

Thank you to @gitbook for the wonderful editor. 

## What This Book is Not

This is not a real book. A better way of thinking of it is as as a journal of my path from junior to a real senior developer.

This is not my work alone. This is a condensation of peoples works that they generously shared to the world. I will attribute those works to them. Thank these wonderful people with an email or comment on their blog if you find their work useful.
